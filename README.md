# SMPTablist
A great minecraft plugin that allows you to see the TPS and how many players are online right now. But the main feature of this plugin is showing in what world(overworld, nether, end) you/others are. This feature can be setted up by showing on the right of the player name inside brackets the world name. Or, changin the player color in the tab. Everything is customizable.
